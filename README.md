# express-order
---------------

A bare bones order system letting users log simple requests - uses __Javascript__ with __PHP__ and an __SQLite__ database.  The system can be set to be offline, in which cases requests cannot be logged.  The DB is automatically created once the first request is logged.

__Installation__

* Just `git clone` this repository into your local machine, and upload the contents to your web server.  [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) is good for FTP uploads.
* That's it!  Web servers with PHP installed (most shared web hosting packages will have) will be able to run the system.
